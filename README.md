# Fun-with-Bokeh
## Expanding on WISKI web API by leveraging Bokeh interactive HTML visualization tools.

In this Repo, I'm sharing several different notebooks where I explored different reporting capabilities using Bokeh.
Bokeh visualizations have several benefits over static .jpg/.png matplotlib outputs:
* Advanced layout tools enable dashboards that show several visualizations at once (and even link them!)
* Visualizations are interactive, allowing viewers to explore the data in more depth.
* The output documents are HTML, which can be opened and viewed by anyone with a web browser.
* Bokeh is scalable, allowing data streaming and dynamic updates when coupled with Bokeh Server.

As with my [SW-Data-Analysis repo](https://github.com/AustinJennings/SW-Data-Analysis), these notebooks represent a huge step forward for my organization.
The ability to leverage our new water quality database's web API opens up a world of possiblilities 
in terms of data sharing, visualization, and exploration. Curated reports can keep decision-makers informed
without them needing data-science chops or experience with the proprietary database GUI. They also save
time for the few database adminis, who can deasily get bogged down with data requests and manual reporting workflows!
